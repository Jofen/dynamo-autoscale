# Because you are very limited by how many downscales you have per day, and
# because downscaling both reads and writes at the same time only counts as a
# single downscale, the following option will queue up downscales until it can
# apply 1 for reads and 1 for writes at the same time. It is recommended that
# you turn this one.
